<h1>On death</h1>
<p>The average life expectancy as of 2023 is around 70.8 years for a male and 76 years for a female<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/demographics/life-expectancy/">^1</a>. This is not a huge amount of time to be alive, considering there were roughly 13.7 billion years that you could have existed alongside the universe. Some people may go on to retire and enjoy their golden years free to do everything they wanted to but may not be physically able to. The vast majority of people will spend a large portion of their free time and <em>good</em> years working a job while having a shorter time for other activities at the weekend or for intermittent periods throughout the year. They will go home, eat, sleep and do it all again for another 4 days of every week. It can start from the age at which you leave school, which you will also spend a valuable and sizeable portion of your life at. When your time comes, you will depart this life for whatever awaits you. Depending on what you believe, this could be another life of eternal damnation or even a place where you share a fluffy white cloud with all the family members and pets that left this world before you. I do believe in a possible afterlife but not one that is parallel to either Christian or Muslim beliefs, I believe in reincarnation of some sort being a possibility, but not the same reincarnation as Buddhism teaches. I believe in a more scientific, at least theoretically, type of reincarnation.</p>
<p>Before you were born, your consciousness did not exist, you were not aware of this but you were somehow a part of this giant nothing anyway. You were, in theory, dead for a very long time. It is possible that you were conscious at some point in the past also and that you just have no memory of it. Regardless, somehow the universe managed to put the pieces of the puzzle that is life together and on this planet, single celled organisms evolved into more complex lifeforms over a long period of time. If this has happened here, then surely there is a possibility that it could have happened elsewhere. There may be a conscious being somewhere in the universe that has a deeper understanding or more proof of what happened before the universe was even here. How did it come into being? Has this happened before? We as a species may never know, but we can theorise about it. Taking the big bang theory as the most credible theory, we are able to say that all matter in the universe originated from a large mass that exploded and caused a tremendous amount of energy to be expelled in the process. The resulting spread of this energy eventually combined enough so that it was <em>alive</em> and even evolved enough to write and think about how it even managed to exist. What if instead of a single big bang, the big bounce theory is correct and all that happens is the universe keeps on expanding and then starts to shrink, causing all of the black holes to eat each other and eventually move to the <em>centre</em> of the universe where it will become increasingly unstable until it once again explodes. Maybe next time it does happen, life will not happen, but maybe the time after that it will. It's possible that the universe has been exploding an infinite number of times, over and over, sometimes creating strange entities that live amongst it's stars and planets, sometimes there is just a lifeless void.</p>
<p>Assuming all of this is happening, it stands to reason that your cells could once again become awakened, maybe in a different form but alive once again in some way. You may not even have a consciousness next time or the previous times it has happened. But maybe one of the times you will once again have a stream of thoughts and feelings. The beauty of this is that there will be no long wait in between switching lives. As your life ends, time also ends with it, you do not experience seconds, minutes or hours as you would here on earth. It would be the same for millennia, which would become as instantaneous as eons. There is a possibility that you would just catapult from one life to the next in an endless arc of character switching. </p>
<p>There is also just a possibility of complete blackness and nothing after death. I do not fear either for I will not know when it is happening.</p>
